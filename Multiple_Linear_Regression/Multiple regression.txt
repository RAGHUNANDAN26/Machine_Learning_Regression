MULTIPLE REGRESSION

y=b0+b1*x1+b2*x2+...+bn*xn

mutiple independent variables
Backward elimination is look what are the independent variable are statistically significant to dependent variable 

STEP 1
 significant value threshold for pvalue 
pvalue of inde valeu below the signi value then idene stay in the model 
pvalue is higher than signi value remove it
